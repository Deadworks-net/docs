# UI panels

> **Namespace:** `DeadworksManaged.Api.UI`

A panel is a box on a player's screen that your plugin controls. It can hold text, images and buttons the player can click.

:::note Requires the launcher
Players only see panels if they joined through the Deadworks launcher. Without it they see nothing.
:::

## Show a panel to a player

Describe what is in the panel, then send it with `BuildLayout`. Give the panel a name, and use the same name every time you talk to it.

```csharp
using DeadworksManaged.Api;
using DeadworksManaged.Api.UI;

public class RoundHud : DeadworksPluginBase
{
    public override string Name => "Round HUD";

    static UINode Layout() => UI.Vertical().Add(
        UI.Label("timer", "0:00"),
        UI.Label("score", "0 - 0"));

    public override void OnClientFullConnect(ClientFullConnectEvent args)
    {
        if (args.Controller is { } controller)
            UI.Panel("round").BuildLayout(controller.Recipients, Layout());
    }
}
```

`UI.Vertical()` stacks what is inside it top to bottom. `UI.Horizontal()` lays it out left to right.

`controller.Recipients` sends to that one player. Use `RecipientFilter.All` to send to everyone.

## Change the text in a panel

Each label has a name. Call `Set` with that name and the new text.

```csharp
UI.Panel("round").Set(controller.Recipients, "timer", "1:24");
```

To change several at once:

```csharp
UI.Panel("round").Build()
    .Set("timer", "1:24")
    .Set("score", "3 - 2")
    .SendTo(RecipientFilter.All);
```

:::warning
`BuildLayout` wipes values set before it. Call `Set` after `BuildLayout`, not before.
:::

## Remove a panel

```csharp
UI.Panel("round").DestroyLayout(controller.Recipients);
```

## Style a panel

Add styles with `WithStyle`. They are Panorama styles, the same ones the game's own UI uses.

```csharp
static UINode Layout() => UI.Vertical()
    .WithStyle("horizontal-align", "center")
    .WithStyle("vertical-align", "top")
    .WithStyle("margin-top", "24px")
    .WithStyle("padding", "8px 14px")
    .WithStyle("background-color", "#0a0c08e6")
    .Add(
        UI.Label("timer", "0:00")
            .WithStyle("font-size", "20px")
            .WithStyle("color", "#FFEFD7"),
        UI.Label("score", "0 - 0")
            .WithStyle("font-size", "14px")
            .WithStyle("color", "#5FE69E"));
```

Panorama styles look like web CSS but aren't. The differences:

- Place a box with `horizontal-align` and `vertical-align`, then nudge it with margins.
- A color can end in two extra digits that set its opacity: `#0a0c08e6`.
- To fill the space that is left, use `width: fill-parent-flow(1.0)`.

## Add a button

Give the button an event name with `OnClick`, then say what happens with `On`.

```csharp
static UINode Layout() => UI.Vertical().Add(
    UI.Label("status", "Ready?"),
    UI.Button("readyButton", "I'm ready").OnClick("ready"));

public override void OnLoad(bool isReload)
{
    UI.Panel("lobby").On("ready", e =>
    {
        UI.Panel("lobby").Set(e.Caller.Recipients, "status", "Waiting for others...");
    });
}
```

`e.Caller` is the player who clicked.

To tell buttons apart, send a value with the click and read it with `e.ArgAt`:

```csharp
UI.Button("cell3", "").OnClick("move", "3");

UI.Panel("board").On("move", e =>
{
    int cell = int.Parse(e.ArgAt(0));
});
```

## Let a player use their mouse

Players can't click a panel while they are aiming. Free their cursor with `RequestCursor`, and give it back with `ReleaseCursor`.

```csharp
UI.Panel("lobby").RequestCursor(controller.Recipients);

UI.Panel("lobby").ReleaseCursor(controller.Recipients);
```

:::note
While the cursor is free, the player can't move, aim or use abilities. Call `ReleaseCursor` or `DestroyLayout` to give it back.
:::

## Style a button

```csharp
UI.Button("readyButton", "I'm ready")
    .WithStyle("padding", "6px 12px")
    .WithStyle("background-color", "#1a241f")
    .WithHoverStyle("background-color", "#2a3a32") // while the mouse is over it
    .WithTextStyle("color", "#FFEFD7")             // the text inside it
    .OnClick("ready");
```

## Show an image

```csharp
UI.Image("logo", "file://{images}/myaddon/logo.vtex");
```

To show a hero's portrait, get the image from the hero:

```csharp
var portrait = Heroes.Atlas.GetHeroData()?.IconImageSmall ?? "";

UI.Image("portrait", portrait);
```

Your own images must reach players first. See [Uploading content](../guides/uploading-content).

## Change a style later

Use `SetStyle` with the name of the thing to change. `SetStyle` doesn't rebuild the panel.

```csharp
UI.Panel("round").SetStyle(controller.Recipients, "score", "color", "#fb6c34");
```

## Animate something

`Animate` changes a style gradually. This shrinks a bar to nothing over 30 seconds:

```csharp
UI.Panel("round").Animate(controller.Recipients, "bar", "width", "0%", "30s");
```

The player's game runs the animation, so send it once.

## Add or remove a row

Use `AppendChild` and `RemoveChild` to change part of a panel without rebuilding it.

```csharp
// Add a label inside the thing named "list"
UI.Panel("scores").AppendChild(controller.Recipients, "list",
    UI.Label("row5", "Abrams: 12"));

// Take it out again
UI.Panel("scores").RemoveChild(controller.Recipients, "row5");
```

If a player's connection drops briefly, their panel returns to its state at your last `BuildLayout` call. Rows you added are lost. Add them back in `UI.ClientResync`:

```csharp
public override void OnLoad(bool isReload)
{
    UI.ClientResync += slot =>
    {
        var controller = Players.FromSlot(slot);
        if (controller != null)
            RebuildScores(controller);
    };
}
```

## Update a panel many times a second

Use `SetUnreliable` for values that change constantly. An unreliable update can be dropped. The next update replaces it.

```csharp
public override void OnGameFrame(bool simulating, bool firstTick, bool lastTick)
{
    UI.Panel("round").Build()
        .SetUnreliable("timer", FormatTime())
        .SetUnreliable("score", FormatScore())
        .SendTo(RecipientFilter.All);
}
```

Send every value each time, even the ones that haven't changed.

## Use your own layout file

For more control, write the panel as a Panorama layout file and ship it to players in an addon.

```text
myaddon/
  panorama/
    layout/killfeed.xml
    scripts/killfeed.js
```

```xml
<root>
    <scripts>
        <include src="s2r://panorama/scripts/dw_addon.js" />
        <include src="file://{resources}/scripts/killfeed.js" />
    </scripts>

    <Panel style="horizontal-align: right; vertical-align: top; flow-children: down;">
        <Label id="headline" text="" />
        <Label id="tally" text="" />
    </Panel>
</root>
```

Load it with `LoadXml`, not `BuildLayout`:

```csharp
UI.Panel("killfeed").LoadXml(controller.Recipients, "file://{resources}/layout/killfeed.xml");
```

After that it works like any other panel. `Set` changes the label with that name:

```csharp
UI.Panel("killfeed").Set(RecipientFilter.All, "headline", "Abrams killed Haze");
```

The addon must reach players before they join. See [Uploading content](../guides/uploading-content).

## Run your own script in a panel

Add a script to your addon to draw values yourself and to send clicks back.

```js
DW.registerPanel({
    init: function (panel) {
        panel.onClick("clearButton", function () {
            panel.send("clear");
        });
    },

    render: function (panel) {
        panel.text("tally", panel.int("total") + " kills this round");
    }
});
```

`render` runs whenever your plugin calls `Set`. `panel.int("total")` reads the value you set. `panel.send("clear")` reaches the `On("clear", ...)` in your plugin.

```csharp
UI.Panel("killfeed").Set(RecipientFilter.All, "total", 7);

UI.Panel("killfeed").On("clear", e =>
{
    UI.Panel("killfeed").Clear(RecipientFilter.All);
});
```

## Check whether a player has your addon

A player without your addon can't load the layout. Listen for that, and show them a plain panel instead.

```csharp
public override void OnLoad(bool isReload)
{
    UI.AddonStatusChanged += (slot, panelId, state) =>
    {
        if (state != AddonState.Failed) return;

        var controller = Players.FromSlot(slot);
        if (controller != null)
            UI.Panel(panelId).BuildLayout(controller.Recipients, Layout());
    };
}
```

## See your changes without restarting

While you work on an addon's files, `Reload` sends each player their panel again.

```csharp
UI.Panel("killfeed").Reload(RecipientFilter.All);
```
