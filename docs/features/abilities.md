# Abilities & items

> **Namespace:** `DeadworksManaged.Api`

A hero's abilities and the items a player buys are the same kind of thing in code. Both live on the player's pawn. Both have an internal name. Item names start with `upgrade_`.

## Find the name of an ability or item

The [abilities database](https://deadworks.net/db/abilities) lists every ability and item, with the name to use in code.

## Give a player an item

```csharp
pawn.AddItem("upgrade_sprint_booster");
```

To give the enhanced version:

```csharp
pawn.AddItem("upgrade_sprint_booster", enhanced: true);
```

`AddItem` returns `null` if it can't give the item.

## Take an item away

```csharp
pawn.RemoveItem("upgrade_sprint_booster");
```

`RemoveItem` gives the player no souls back. To sell the item so they get souls back, use `SellItem`:

```csharp
pawn.SellItem("upgrade_sprint_booster");
```

## Check whether a player has an item

```csharp
bool hasIt = pawn.AbilityComponent.FindAbilityByName("upgrade_sprint_booster") != null;
```

## List a player's items

```csharp
foreach (var ability in pawn.AbilityComponent.Abilities)
{
    if (ability.IsItem)
        Console.WriteLine(ability.AbilityName);
}
```

`Abilities` holds everything on the hero: abilities, items, weapons and innates. `IsItem` picks out the items.

## Give an item that attaches to an ability

Some items, like Echo Shard, only work once they are attached to one of the hero's abilities. Say which ability when you give the item.

```csharp
pawn.AddItem("upgrade_echo_shard", EAbilitySlot.Signature1);
```

The game doesn't allow every pairing. To find out why one failed, use `TryAddItem`:

```csharp
var result = pawn.TryAddItem("upgrade_echo_shard", EAbilitySlot.Signature4, out var item);

if (result != ImbueResult.Success)
    Console.WriteLine($"Couldn't give the item: {result}");
```

If it fails, the player doesn't get the item.

## Get one of a player's abilities

A hero's four abilities are in the slots `Signature1` to `Signature4`. `Signature4` is the ultimate.

```csharp
var ultimate = pawn.AbilityComponent.GetAbilityBySlot(EAbilitySlot.Signature4);
if (ultimate == null) return;

Console.WriteLine(ultimate.AbilityName);
```

## Swap one of a player's abilities

Remove the old one, then add the new one to a slot. Slots 0 to 3 are the four abilities.

```csharp
pawn.RemoveAbility("ability_priest_weaponswap");
pawn.AddAbility("ability_familiar_ability01", slot: 3);
```

## Unlock and upgrade a player's abilities

Set `UpgradeBits` to `0b11111` to unlock an ability and fully upgrade it.

```csharp
foreach (var ability in pawn.AbilityComponent.Abilities)
{
    if (ability.IsSignature)
        ability.UpgradeBits = 0b11111;
}
```

## Reset a player's cooldowns

```csharp
pawn.ResetAllAbilityCooldowns();
```

`ResetAllAbilityCooldowns()` makes every ability and item ready to use again. It also refills their charges.

To reset one ability:

```csharp
pawn.ResetAbilityCooldown(EAbilitySlot.Signature4);
```

## Check whether an ability is on cooldown

```csharp
var ultimate = pawn.AbilityComponent.GetAbilityBySlot(EAbilitySlot.Signature4);
if (ultimate == null) return;

if (ultimate.IsOnCooldown)
{
    float secondsLeft = ultimate.CooldownEnd - GlobalVars.CurTime;
}
```

An ability that uses charges can also be out of charges. `RemainingCharges` is how many it has left. `MaxCharges` is how many it can hold.

## Put an ability on cooldown

Set when the cooldown started and when it ends. Both are times on the game's clock.

```csharp
ultimate.CooldownStart = GlobalVars.CurTime;
ultimate.CooldownEnd = GlobalVars.CurTime + 30f;
```

## Make a player use an ability

```csharp
int result = pawn.ExecuteAbilityBySlot(EAbilitySlot.Signature1);

if (result != 0)
    Console.WriteLine("The ability couldn't be used.");
```

## Stop players using abilities

Override `OnAbilityAttempt` and block the buttons you don't want to work.

```csharp
public override void OnAbilityAttempt(AbilityAttemptEvent args)
{
    // Nobody can use their ultimate
    args.Block(InputButton.Ability4);
}
```

To block everything for one player:

```csharp
private readonly HashSet<int> _silenced = new();

public override void OnAbilityAttempt(AbilityAttemptEvent args)
{
    if (_silenced.Contains(args.PlayerSlot))
        args.BlockAll(); // every ability and every item
}
```

To block only abilities or only items, use `BlockAllAbilities()` or `BlockAllItems()`.

## Run code when a player uses an ability

Listen for the `player_used_ability` [game event](game-events).

```csharp
[GameEventHandler("player_used_ability")]
public HookResult OnPlayerUsedAbility(PlayerUsedAbilityEvent args)
{
    var pawn = args.Player?.As<CCitadelPlayerPawn>();
    if (pawn == null) return HookResult.Continue;

    Console.WriteLine($"{pawn.Controller?.PlayerName} used {args.Abilityname}");

    return HookResult.Continue;
}
```

## Refill a player's stamina

```csharp
var max = pawn.AbilityComponent.ResourceStamina.MaxValue;

pawn.SetStamina(max);
```

`pawn.GetStamina()` returns how much they have now.
