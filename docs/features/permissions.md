# Permissions

> **Namespace:** `DeadworksManaged.Api`

A permission limits who can run a command. Players get permissions from roles, which the server owner sets up.

## Give a command a permission

Set `Permission` on the command.

```csharp
[Command("heal", Permission = "myplugin.heal")]
public void CmdHeal(Caller caller)
{
    var pawn = caller.Player?.GetHeroPawn();
    if (pawn == null)
        throw new CommandException("Only players can heal.");

    pawn.Heal(pawn.GetMaxHealth());
}
```

Now only players with `myplugin.heal` can run `/heal`. Everyone else sees `You don't have permission to use this command.`

Start the permission with your plugin's name, so server owners can tell where it comes from.

The server console can always run every command. The built-in `admin` role has every permission.

## Give a role the permission

To let players use the command, give the permission to a role, then give players that role.

1. Open `configs/permissions/roles.jsonc` and add a role:

   ```jsonc
   {
     "default": {
       "permissions": []
     },
     "admin": {
       "permissions": ["*"],
       "immunity": 100
     },

     "medic": {
       "permissions": ["myplugin.heal"]
     }
   }
   ```

2. Reload the file. In the server console, run:

   ```text
   dw_perm_reload
   ```

3. Join the server, then give yourself the role. In the server console, run:

   ```text
   dw_role_grant <your name> medic
   ```

4. Type `/heal` in chat.

Your role applies a few seconds after you join, once Steam confirms your account.

To let every player use a command, give the permission to the `default` role, which everyone has.

## Check a permission in code

`caller.HasPermission` checks a permission inside your method. Use it when a command does more for some players:

```csharp
[Command("heal", Permission = "myplugin.heal")]
public void CmdHeal(Caller caller, Target? target = null)
{
    if (target != null && !caller.HasPermission("myplugin.heal.others"))
        throw new CommandException("You can only heal yourself.");

    // ...
}
```

Add `[DeclarePermission]` to your plugin class for each permission you only check in code. Server owners then see it in the list of your plugin's permissions:

```csharp
[DeclarePermission("myplugin.heal.others", Description = "Heal other players")]
public class MyPlugin : DeadworksPluginBase
```
