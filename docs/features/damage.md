# Damage

> **Namespace:** `DeadworksManaged.Api`

Plugins can deal damage to any [entity](entities). They can also watch, change or block damage as it happens.

## Damage an entity

```csharp
pawn.Hurt(50f);
```

`Hurt` takes 50 health from the player. It can kill them.

## Give an attacker the credit

```csharp
target.Hurt(100f, attacker: shooter);
```

If this kills the target, the kill goes to `shooter` and shows in the kill feed.

## Deal damage over time

Use a [timer](timers#run-something-a-set-number-of-times) to deal small amounts of damage repeatedly.

```csharp
Timer.Sequence(step =>
{
    if (step.Run > 10 || !target.IsValid)
        return step.Done();

    target.Hurt(10f, attacker: attacker);

    return step.Wait(200.Milliseconds());
});
```

This deals 10 damage every 200 milliseconds. It stops once `step.Run` passes 10 or the target is gone.

## Run code when something takes damage

Override `OnTakeDamage`. It runs for every hit on the server.

```csharp
public override HookResult OnTakeDamage(TakeDamageEvent ev)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{ev.Entity.DesignerName} took {ev.Info.Damage} damage");

    return HookResult.Continue;
}
```

`ev.Entity` is whoever is being hurt. `ev.Info` describes the hit:

- `ev.Info.Damage`: the amount of damage.
- `ev.Info.Attacker`: the entity that dealt it.
- `ev.Info.Ability`: the ability or item that dealt it.

Both `Attacker` and `Ability` can be `null`.

## Block damage

Return `HookResult.Stop` to cancel the hit.

```csharp
public override HookResult OnTakeDamage(TakeDamageEvent ev)
{
    // Patrons can't be hurt
    if (ev.Entity.DesignerName == "npc_boss_tier3")
        return HookResult.Stop;

    return HookResult.Continue;
}
```

## Change how much damage a hit does

Set `ev.Info.Damage`.

```csharp
public override HookResult OnTakeDamage(TakeDamageEvent ev)
{
    // Everything does double damage
    ev.Info.Damage *= 2;

    return HookResult.Continue;
}
```

## Only react to one ability or item

Check the name of `ev.Info.Ability`. The [abilities database](https://deadworks.net/db/abilities) lists every name.

```csharp
public override HookResult OnTakeDamage(TakeDamageEvent ev)
{
    if (ev.Info.Ability?.SubclassVData?.Name != "upgrade_discord")
        return HookResult.Continue;

    // This hit came from that item

    return HookResult.Continue;
}
```

## Kill an entity

`Hurt` can't guarantee a kill. Build the hit yourself and add the `ForceDeath` flag.

```csharp
using var info = new CTakeDamageInfo(
    damage: 1f,
    attacker: null,
    inflictor: null,
    ability: null,
    damageType: 0);

info.DamageFlags = TakeDamageFlags.ForceDeath | TakeDamageFlags.AllowSuicide;

target.TakeDamage(info);
```

Always create a `CTakeDamageInfo` with `using`, as above, so it's disposed after use.

## Change how a hit behaves

Build the hit the same way, with different flags.

```csharp
info.DamageFlags = TakeDamageFlags.PreventDeath;
```

Common flags:

- `PreventDeath`: leaves the target on 1 health at worst.
- `ForceDeath`: always kills.
- `SuppressDamageModification`: ignores armor and resistances.
- `SuppressPhysicsForce`: deals no knockback.
- `SuppressEffects`: shows no visual effects.
- `SuppressKillCredit`: gives nobody the kill.
