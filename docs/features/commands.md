# Commands

> **Namespace:** `DeadworksManaged.Api`

A command runs a method in your plugin when someone types its name in chat or the console.

## Add a command

Put `[Command]` on a method.

```csharp
public class MyPlugin : DeadworksPluginBase
{
    public override string Name => "My Plugin";

    [Command("hello", Description = "Say hello")]
    public void CmdHello(Caller caller)
    {
        caller.Reply($"Hello, {caller.Name}!");
    }
}
```

That gives you three ways to run it:

- `/hello` in chat. Other players don't see the typed message.
- `!hello` in chat. Other players see the typed message.
- `dw_hello` in the console.

`Description` is the help text shown by `dw_help`.

## Reply to whoever ran it

Make `Caller` the first parameter. It is whoever ran the command: a player, or the server console.

```csharp
caller.Reply("Done.");
```

A player sees the reply in chat. The server console sees it in the console.

## Get the player who ran it

```csharp
[Command("heal")]
public void CmdHeal(Caller caller)
{
    var pawn = caller.Player?.GetHeroPawn();
    if (pawn == null)
        throw new CommandException("Only players can heal.");

    pawn.Heal(pawn.GetMaxHealth());
}
```

`caller.Player` is `null` when the server console ran the command. See [Players](players) for what you can do with one.

## Refuse with a message

Throw `CommandException`. The caller sees your message wherever they typed the command. The rest of your method doesn't run.

```csharp
throw new CommandException("You can't do that right now.");
```

Any other exception is a bug in your plugin. The server console gets the full stack trace. The caller sees only `That command failed. The server console has details.`

## Take arguments

Add more parameters. Deadworks fills them in from what the caller typed.

```csharp
[Command("givesouls", Description = "Give yourself souls")]
public void CmdGiveSouls(Caller caller, int amount = 50000)
{
    // ...
}
```

```text
/givesouls
/givesouls 2500
```

A parameter can be a `string`, a `bool`, a number (`int`, `long`, `uint`, `ulong`, `float`, `double`) or an enum, or a nullable version of one. One with a default value is optional. An enum takes its value names (`red`, `blue`), not numbers.

If what they typed doesn't fit, Deadworks shows them the usage and doesn't run your method:

```text
Usage: dw_givesouls [amount=50000]
```

## Pick players

Take a `Target` to let the caller name one or more players:

```csharp
[Command("healplayer", Permission = "myplugin.heal")]
public void CmdHealPlayer(Caller caller, Target target)
{
    foreach (var player in target)
    {
        var pawn = player.GetHeroPawn();
        pawn?.Heal(pawn.GetMaxHealth());
    }
}
```

```text
/healplayer lapka
/healplayer #3
/healplayer @team
```

A `Target` accepts part of a name, `#slot`, a SteamID, `@me`, `@team`, `@enemy` and `@all`. If nothing matches, Deadworks tells the caller and doesn't run your method. Use `target.Single()` when the command only makes sense for one player. See [`Target`](/api-reference/commands/target).

## Parse your own types

For a type Deadworks doesn't parse, register a converter in `OnLoad`. Throw `CommandException` to tell the caller what's wrong with what they typed:

```csharp
public override void OnLoad(bool isReload)
{
    CommandConverters.Register<Coord>(text =>
        text.Split(',') is [var x, var y] && int.TryParse(x, out var xi) && int.TryParse(y, out var yi)
            ? new Coord(xi, yi)
            : throw new CommandException($"'{text}' isn't x,y."));
}
```

Your converters are removed when your plugin unloads. A converter applies to every plugin's commands, so register them for your own types. Registering one for a type Deadworks already parses, such as `int` or `Target`, throws `ArgumentException`.

If a parameter's type can't be parsed at all, the server console warns when the plugin loads, and the command only ever shows its usage.

## Take a whole sentence

Make the last parameter `params string[]` to collect everything else the caller typed.

```csharp
[Command("sayas")]
public void CmdSayAs(Caller caller, string speaker, params string[] messageParts)
{
    var text = string.Join(' ', messageParts);
}
```

```text
/sayas announcer the match starts now
```

## Give a command a second name

Add more names after the first.

```csharp
[Command("heal", "h")]
```

Now `/h`, `!h` and `dw_h` work too.

## Make a command chat only or console only

```csharp
[Command("hello", ChatOnly = true)]    // only /hello and !hello
[Command("hello", ConsoleOnly = true)] // only dw_hello
```

:::note
Players can still run a `ConsoleOnly` command from their own game console. To keep a command to the server console, use `ServerOnly` instead.
:::

## Only let the server console run a command

```csharp
[Command("cvardump", ServerOnly = true)]
```

To limit a command to certain players instead, set its [`Permission`](/api-reference/commands/commandattribute#permission).

## Hide a command

```csharp
[Command("secret", Hidden = true)]       // left out of dw_help
[Command("secret", SuppressChat = true)] // typing !secret isn't shown in chat
```

## Wait for something slow

A command can be `async` if it returns `Task`. Code after an `await` continues on the game thread, so it can touch the game as usual.

```csharp
[Command("stats")]
public async Task CmdStats(Caller caller)
{
    var stats = await _database.LoadStatsAsync(caller.SteamId64);
    caller.Reply($"You've played {stats.Matches} matches.");
}
```

If the player has left by then, the reply does nothing. An exception thrown after an `await` is handled the same way as one thrown straight away.

:::warning Don't use `async void`
An exception in an `async void` method can't be caught and would crash the server. Deadworks refuses to register such a command and says so in the server console. Return `Task` instead.
