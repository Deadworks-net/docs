# Use admin commands

Deadworks ships with a simple Admin plugin that adds commands to kick, ban, gag and mute players, and to run the server. For more admin tools, see the plugins shared on the [Deadworks Discord](https://discord.gg/d3JHnVGA26).

## Type a command

Every admin command works three ways:

| Where | Type | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| Chat | `!` or `/`, then the command | `!kick lapka` |
| Your game console | `dw_`, then the command | `dw_kick lapka` |
| The server console | `dw_`, then the command | `dw_kick lapka` |

Admin commands never show in public chat. `dw_help` lists the commands you can use.

## Pick a player

| Type | Picks |
|------|-------|
| `lapka` | The player with that name, or part of it |
| `"Big Dave"` | A name with spaces |
| `#3` | The player in slot 3. `who` lists the slots. |
| `76561197960287931` | A player by SteamID, even after they've left |
| `@me`, `@team`, `@enemy`, `@all` | Yourself, your team, the other team, everyone |

## Moderation commands

Times are in minutes: `60` is an hour, `1440` a day, `10080` a week. `0` is permanent.

| Command | Does |
|---------|------|
| `kick <player> [reason]` | Kicks a player. They can rejoin. |
| `ban <player\|steamid> <minutes> [reason]` | Bans a player, on the server or not. Also `addban`. |
| `unban <steamid> [reason]` | Lifts a ban |
| `bans` | Lists active bans |
| `gag <player\|steamid> <minutes> [reason]` | Stops a player typing in chat |
| `ungag <player\|steamid> [reason]` | Lifts a gag |
| `gags` | Lists active gags |
| `mute <player\|steamid> <minutes> [reason]` | Stops a player talking on voice chat |
| `unmute <player\|steamid> [reason]` | Lifts a mute |
| `mutes` | Lists active mutes |
| `slay <player>` | Kills a player's hero |
| `who [player]` | Lists players, with their slot, SteamID, team and roles |
| `penalties [player\|steamid]` | Shows a player's bans, gags and mutes, past and present. Anyone can look up their own. |

```text
!gag lapka 30 spamming chat
!ban lapka 1440 cheating
!ban 76561197960287931 0 ban evasion
```

The time comes before the reason: `!gag lapka spamming` doesn't work.

Deadworks enforces bans, gags and mutes. They're saved in `configs\penalties\penalties.jsonc` and last across restarts and map changes.

## Server commands

| Command | Does |
|---------|------|
| `map [name\|cancel]` | Changes map after a short warning. On its own, lists the maps. `cancel` calls off a pending change. |
| `cvar <name> [value]` | Shows or changes a server setting, such as `sv_cheats` or `sv_password` |
| `resetcvar <name>` | Puts a setting back to its default |
| `execcfg <file>` | Runs a config file from the server's `cfg\` folder |
| `rcon <command>` | Runs any server console command and shows its output |

## See what admins did

Every admin action is written to `game\bin\win64\logs\admin\`, one file per day. Players see `ADMIN: kicked lapka: <reason>` in chat. Admins see who did it.
