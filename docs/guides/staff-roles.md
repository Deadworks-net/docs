# Setting up staff roles

A typical staff team for the [Admin plugin](../getting-started/server-admins/use-admin-tools) has trial moderators, moderators, senior moderators and admins. The built-in `admin` role stays as it is, with every permission. Each rank can do more than the one below it, and can't act against the ranks above.

Before you start, complete [Set up admins](../getting-started/server-admins/set-up-admins). For how roles, wildcards and immunity work in general, see [How permissions work](admins-and-permissions).

## The plan

| | Trial Mod | Moderator | Senior Mod | Admin |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Kick, gag, mute, `who` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Bans (including permanent and offline), unban, slay | | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Change map, run configs | | | ✅ | ✅ |
| Add and remove staff | | | ✅ | ✅ |
| Cvars (including `sv_cheats` and passwords), `rcon`, everything else | | | | ✅ |
| Immunity | 10 | 50 | 90 | 100 |

## Step 1: Write the roles

Add three roles to `configs/permissions/roles.jsonc`, next to `default` and `admin`. Leave those two as they are:

```jsonc
{
  "default": {
    "permissions": []
  },

  "admin": {
    "permissions": ["*"],
    "immunity": 100
  },

  "trialmod": {
    "permissions": [
      "admin.moderation.kick",
      "admin.moderation.gag",
      "admin.moderation.mute",
      "admin.moderation.who",
      "deadworks.admin.notify"
    ],
    "immunity": 10
  },

  "moderator": {
    "inherits": ["trialmod"],
    "permissions": [
      "admin.moderation.ban",
      "admin.moderation.unban",
      "admin.moderation.slay"
    ],
    "immunity": 50
  },

  "seniormod": {
    "inherits": ["moderator"],
    "permissions": [
      "admin.server.*",
      "-admin.server.rcon",
      "-admin.server.cvar",
      "deadworks.permissions.view",
      "deadworks.permissions.manage"
    ],
    "immunity": 90
  }
}
```

Then load it:

```text
dw_perm_reload
dw_role_list
```

### What each part does

- **`inherits`** passes permissions up the ladder. A moderator gets everything a trial mod has, plus their own. A senior mod gets everything a moderator has.
- **Immunity** is set on each role here. A role without an `immunity` takes the highest one among the roles it inherits.
- **`deadworks.admin.notify`** lets staff see *who* did something when the server announces an admin action. By default, players only see `ADMIN: …` (see `admin.show_activity` in [`deadworks.jsonc`](admins-and-permissions#deadworksjsonc)). Every other staff role inherits from `trialmod`, so they all get it.
- **`admin.moderation.ban`** covers permanent bans and banning players who've left by SteamID, so moderators can do both. Give `ban` only to people you trust with that.
- **The seniormod role** gets the whole server group except `rcon` and `cvar`, which leaves changing map and running configs. The denies (`-`) take those two out of the `admin.server.*` wildcard, because an exact entry beats a wildcard in the same role.
- **`cvar`** is left to admins because it also covers `sv_cheats` and passwords like `sv_password`.
- **`deadworks.permissions.manage`** lets senior mods add and remove staff. See [Step 3](#step-3-let-senior-mods-manage-staff).
- **The `admin` role** has `*`: everything, including permissions that plugins add later.

## Step 2: Add your staff

From the server console, or from your game console as an admin (these commands don't work in chat):

```text
dw_role_grant greeny trialmod
dw_role_grant lapka moderator
dw_role_grant mastardy seniormod
```

You can use part of their name or `#slot` while they're on the server. For someone who isn't, use their SteamID, or the exact name saved with their entry in `players.jsonc`. Each grant saves to `players.jsonc`, so it lasts across restarts.

**Promoting someone:** grant the new role and take away the old one.

```text
dw_role_grant <player> moderator
dw_role_revoke <player> trialmod
```

Keeping the old role gives them nothing extra, because it's inherited. It only clutters `players.jsonc`.

**Trying someone out for a session:** add `--temp` and the role disappears when the server restarts.

```text
dw_role_grant newbie trialmod --temp
```

**Removing someone from staff:**

```text
dw_role_revoke <player> moderator
```

A role that has since been deleted from `roles.jsonc` can still be revoked.

## Step 3: Let senior mods manage staff

Senior mods have `deadworks.permissions.manage`, so they can run `dw_role_grant` and `dw_role_revoke` from their own console. These rules limit what they can change:

- **You can only give out a role if you hold everything it gives,** including what it inherits. A role's denies don't give anything, so you don't need to hold them. A senior mod holds everything `moderator` and `trialmod` give.
- **The role's immunity must be lower than yours.** A senior mod (`90`) can hand out `trialmod` (`10`) and `moderator` (`50`), but not `seniormod` or `admin`: `You can't give out seniormod: its immunity (90) isn't lower than yours (90).`
- **You can only change players whose immunity is lower than yours.** Equal isn't enough. A senior mod can promote or demote moderators, trial mods and players with no role, but not other senior mods or admins. Once someone is a senior mod, only an admin or the server console can change their roles.
- **Nobody can change their own roles or permissions.**
- **Admins (`100`) can only be changed from the server console,** because nobody has higher immunity.

The same rules apply to single permissions with `dw_perm_grant`. A senior mod can't hand out `admin.server.rcon`, because they don't have it. Removing a deny from someone counts as giving them the permission, so a senior mod can't lift `-admin.server.rcon` from a player either:

```text
Removing -admin.server.rcon would give lapka (76561197960287931) admin.server.rcon, which you don't hold yourself.
```

When a rule stops someone, the reply says which one, for example `You can't change mastardy (76561197960287933): you need higher immunity than theirs (90).`

Grants, revokes and reloads (`dw_role_grant`, `dw_role_revoke`, `dw_perm_grant`, `dw_perm_revoke`, `dw_perm_reload`) are written to the admin log in `logs/admin/`. Each entry records who made the change.

:::tip Staff who only manage trial mods
To let some staff manage trial mods and nobody else, give them a role that inherits `trialmod`, adds `deadworks.permissions.manage`, and has immunity between trial mods and moderators, such as `30`. They can add and remove trial mods. They can't hand out their own role, because its immunity isn't lower than theirs, and they can't change moderators.
:::

## Step 4: Check it

```text
] dw_perm_check greeny admin.moderation.ban
greeny (76561197960287932): admin.moderation.ban is denied: no grant matches

] dw_perm_check lapka admin.moderation.ban
lapka (76561197960287931): admin.moderation.ban is allowed by "admin.moderation.ban" from role:moderator

] dw_perm_check mastardy admin.moderation.ban
mastardy (76561197960287933): admin.moderation.ban is allowed by "admin.moderation.ban" from role:moderator (via seniormod)

] dw_perm_check mastardy admin.server.rcon
mastardy (76561197960287933): admin.server.rcon is denied by "-admin.server.rcon" from role:seniormod
```

`dw_perm_list <player>` shows everything about one person: their roles, what they inherit, and their immunity.

Admin plugin actions are written to `logs/admin/`, one file per day. Read it after adding new staff.

## One player, one exception

To give or take away a single permission for one person without making a new role, grant it directly. This lets moderator lapka also change map, and stops senior mod mastardy changing map:

```text
dw_perm_grant lapka admin.server.map
dw_perm_grant mastardy -admin.server.map
```

A player's own entry is checked before any of their roles, so anything you put there always wins.
