# Uploading content

Custom content (Panorama addons, models, maps) reaches players through the Deadworks launcher. The launcher downloads whatever your server advertises before the game starts. Distributing a file takes two steps: upload it so clients can fetch it, then list it in the config so the server advertises it.

## Get your server token

Your server gets its credentials the first time it registers with the server browser. It saves them to:

```
game/bin/win64/configs/ServerBrowser/credentials.json
```

```json
{
  "server_id": "…",
  "server_token": "…"
}
```

:::note
The file doesn't exist until the server registers. Start the server once and let it register before you look for the file.
:::

## Upload

Go to `https://deadworks.net/server/<server_id>/content`, paste your `server_token`, and upload your assets.

:::warning Names are globally unique
Addon and map names are claimed across all of Deadworks, not per server. Once someone uploads content under a name, nobody else can reuse it. Pick a name specific to your server or project.
:::

## List it in the config

Add each name under `serverbrowser` in `game/bin/win64/configs/deadworks.jsonc`, without the `.vpk` extension:

```jsonc
{
  "serverbrowser": {
    "content_addons": ["myaddon"],
    "extra_maps": ["dl_express"]
  }
}
```

:::note
The server reads the config once at startup. Restart the server after editing it.
:::

### `content_addons`

VPKs the server mounts and clients download. On startup, the server advertises the list to connecting clients. It mounts each entry from `deadworks_mods/vpks/<name>.vpk`, so the VPK must be on the server as well as uploaded. The launcher puts the client's copy in `citadel/deadworks_addons/vpks/`.

### `extra_maps`

Maps clients download ahead of time. A map can't be mounted at runtime the way an addon can, so maps have their own list. The launcher downloads them into `citadel/maps/` before the game launches. List the name only, without an extension.

## Gotchas

- **An unlisted server distributes nothing.** With `"unlisted": true` in the config, or `-nomaster` on the command line, the server never registers or sends heartbeats. It never mounts content addons, and it never gets credentials.
- **Upload and config are separate steps.** Uploading a file doesn't advertise it. Listing a name that was never uploaded gives clients nothing to download.
- **Names must match everywhere.** The string in `content_addons` is the VPK's filename without `.vpk`, on the server and in the upload alike.
