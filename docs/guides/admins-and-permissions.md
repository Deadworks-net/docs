# How permissions work

A reference for the permission files and commands.

Plugins say which **permission** each command needs. You decide who has it with roles. Commands that don't need a permission work for everyone. The server console can always run everything.

## Files

Everything is in `game/bin/win64/configs/permissions/`. Run `dw_perm_reload` after editing.

| File | What it's for |
|------|---------------|
| `roles.jsonc` | Defines what each role can do |
| `players.jsonc` | Lists which players hold which roles |
| `overrides.jsonc` | Changes what a command requires |
| `generated/` | Lists every plugin's commands and permissions. Read-only: rewritten when plugins load and on `dw_perm_reload`. |

## roles.jsonc

A new server's `roles.jsonc` has only `default` and `admin` (`*`, immunity `100`). Here it is with a `moderator` role added:

```jsonc
{
  "default": {
    "permissions": []
  },
  "moderator": {
    "permissions": ["admin.moderation.*", "-admin.moderation.ban"],
    "immunity": 50
  },
  "admin": {
    "permissions": ["*"],
    "immunity": 100
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `permissions` | Lists what the role can do. See [Writing permissions](#writing-permissions). |
| `inherits` | Lists other roles whose permissions this role also gets, e.g. `["moderator"]` |
| `immunity` | Sets the role's [immunity](#immunity). Defaults to the highest of the roles it inherits, or `0`. |

Every player has the `default` role.

### Writing permissions

| You write | It means |
|-----------|----------|
| `admin.moderation.ban` | That permission |
| `admin.moderation.*` | Everything starting with `admin.moderation.` |
| `*` | Everything |
| `-admin.moderation.ban` | **Not** that permission |

Within one role, the most specific entry wins. A deny wins a tie, so `["*", "-admin.moderation.ban"]` means everything except banning. A role's own entries beat what it inherits.

Across roles, a player has a permission if **any** of their roles gives it. A deny in one role doesn't take away what another role gives.

:::note
To take a permission away from one player, put the deny in their own entry in `players.jsonc`. A deny in one of their roles doesn't remove it if another role grants it.
:::

### Immunity

A player can't target anyone with **higher** immunity than their own, so a moderator (`50`) can't kick an admin (`100`). A player's immunity is the highest of their roles'.

## players.jsonc

```jsonc
{
  "76561197960287930": {
    "name": "wisp",
    "roles": ["admin"]
  },
  "76561197960287931": {
    "name": "lapka",
    "roles": ["moderator"],
    "permissions": ["admin.moderation.ban"],
    "immunity": 60
  }
}
```

Each key is a SteamID (SteamID64, `STEAM_0:…` or `[U:1:…]`).

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Holds a note for you. The console commands accept it for players who aren't on the server. |
| `roles` | Lists the roles the player holds |
| `permissions` | Adds permissions, or `-denies`, for this player only. These beat their roles. |
| `immunity` | Replaces the immunity their roles give |

## overrides.jsonc

```jsonc
{
  "commands": {
    "givesouls":  "itemtest.cheats",   // require a permission
    "rtd":        "",                  // anyone can use it
    "Admin:kick": "custom.kick"        // only the Admin plugin's kick
  }
}
```

## deadworks.jsonc

In `configs/deadworks.jsonc`, with their defaults:

```jsonc
"permissions": {
  "store": "json",
  "require_steam_auth": true
},
"admin": {
  "show_activity": {
    "players": "anonymous",
    "notified": "named"
  },
  "log_dir": "logs/admin"
},
"penalties": {
  "store": "json",
  "history_days": 90
}
```

A `deadworks.jsonc` from an older version doesn't have these sections. Missing settings use the defaults above. Add a section only to change a value.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `permissions.store` | Sets where roles and players come from. `json` is the files on this page. A plugin can add another, such as a database. |
| `permissions.require_steam_auth` | Makes a player's roles apply only once Steam confirms their account, a few seconds after they join. Until then they only have `default`, so nobody can fake an admin's SteamID. For LAN servers, see below. |
| `admin.show_activity.players` | Sets what players see when an admin does something: `named` (`wisp: slayed lapka`), `anonymous` (`ADMIN: slayed lapka`) or `none` |
| `admin.show_activity.notified` | Sets the same, for players with `deadworks.admin.notify` |
| `admin.log_dir` | Sets the folder for the daily admin log, relative to `game/bin/win64` |
| `penalties.store` | Sets where bans, gags and mutes are kept. `json` is `configs/penalties/penalties.jsonc`. |
| `penalties.history_days` | Sets how many days lifted and expired penalties are kept as history. `0` keeps them forever. |

:::danger
On a LAN server, skip the Steam wait by setting `permissions.require_steam_auth` to `false` and restarting, or by putting `sv_lan 1` in `server.cfg`. `sv_lan` is read when the first player joins, so changing it later needs a restart. Never do either on a server reachable from the internet: anyone can then claim an admin's SteamID.
:::

## When a file has a mistake

Deadworks locks things down rather than guess, so a broken file can stop people doing things. The server console says which file, line and column is wrong.

| Broken file | What happens | To fix |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| `deadworks.jsonc` | Nobody has any permissions, new players can't join, and the server isn't listed. The server console still works. | Fix it and restart the server |
| `roles.jsonc` or `players.jsonc` | When the server starts: nobody has any roles. On a reload: the previous roles are kept. | Fix it and run `dw_perm_reload` |
| `overrides.jsonc` | When the server starts: players can't run any command, even public ones. On a reload: the previous overrides are kept. | Fix it and run `dw_perm_reload` |
| `penalties.jsonc` | When the server starts: new players can't join, because bans can't be checked. Later: existing penalties stay enforced, but changes are refused. | Fix it and run `dw_penalties_reload` |

:::warning
Deadworks ignores a setting it doesn't know, such as a misspelled `immunty`, and prints a warning in the console. The setting has no effect. Check the console after editing.
:::

## Console commands

These work in the server console, and in a player's game console if they have the permission. They don't work in chat.

`<player>` can be part of a name, `#slot`, a SteamID, or the name saved in `players.jsonc`.

| Command | Permission | What it does |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| `dw_perm_reload` | `deadworks.permissions.reload` | Reloads the permission files |
| `dw_role_list` | `deadworks.permissions.view` | Lists roles |
| `dw_perm_list <player>` | `deadworks.permissions.view` | Shows a player's roles, permissions and immunity |
| `dw_perm_check <player> <command\|permission>` | `deadworks.permissions.view` | Shows whether a player can use a command or has a permission, and why |
| `dw_role_grant <player> <role> [--temp]` | `deadworks.permissions.manage` | Gives a player a role |
| `dw_role_revoke <player> <role> [--temp]` | `deadworks.permissions.manage` | Takes a role away |
| `dw_perm_grant <player> <permission> [--temp]` | `deadworks.permissions.manage` | Gives a player a permission, or `-permission` to deny one |
| `dw_perm_revoke <player> <permission> [--temp]` | `deadworks.permissions.manage` | Removes a permission or deny from a player |
| `dw_penalties_reload` | `deadworks.penalties.reload` | Reloads bans, gags and mutes |
| `dw_plugin <list\|enable\|disable\|commands> [plugin]` | `deadworks.plugins.manage` | Manages plugins |
| `dw_reloadconfig [plugin]` | `deadworks.config.reload` | Reloads plugin configs |
| `dw_help` | none | Lists the commands you can use |

Players using the grant and revoke commands:

- can only change players with lower immunity than theirs,
- can only give out roles and permissions they hold themselves, and only roles with lower immunity than theirs,
- can't change their own roles or permissions.

Removing a `-deny` from someone counts as giving them the permission. See [Let senior mods manage staff](staff-roles#step-3-let-senior-mods-manage-staff).
